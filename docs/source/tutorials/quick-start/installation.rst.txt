Model Repository
################
When using the H1st framework, for machine-learning models, storage, loading
and versioning is handled by the framework, but you still need to designate
where the models will be stored.

This is done in one of 2-ways:
* Set the `H1ST_MODEL_REPO_PATH` environment variable. This can either point to
a local storage repository or an S3 bucket.
* Create a `config.py` file in the same directory as your model module, and define `MODEL_REPO_PATH = '/path/to/model/repo/'`
