AI-RULE for Trustworthy AI
==========================

As AI systems become pervasive, and are applied to life-critical use-cases,
there are increasing concerns about the power and trustworthiness of these
systems. Human-First AI takes into account these concerns and supports the
implementation of a set of actionable rules to ensure the development of
trustworthy AI. The principles are set forth in the AI-RULE methodology below.

H1st models & applications should exhibit the following properties:

=====	==============	===========
