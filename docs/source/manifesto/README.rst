*“We humans have .. insight that can then be mixed with powerful
AI .. to help move society forward. Second, we also have to build
trust directly into our technology .. And third, all of the
technology we build must be inclusive and respectful to everyone.”*

    *— Satya Nadella, Microsoft CEO*

As trail-blazers in Industrial AI, our team at Aitomatic has
found Satya Nadella‘s observations to be powerful and prescient.
Many hard-won lessons from the field have led us to adopt this
approach which we call Human-First AI (H1st AI).

We‘re excited to share these ideas and concrete implementation
of H1st AI with you and the open-source community!

Learn the Key Concepts
----------------------

Human-First AI solves three critical challenges in real-world data science:

    1.	**Industrial AI needs human insight.** In so many important
	applications, there isn‘t enough data for ML. For example,
	last year‘s product‘s data does not apply to this year‘s new
	model. Or, equipment not yet shipped obviously have no data
	history to speak of. H1st combines human knowledge and any
	available data to enable intelligent systems, and companies
	can achieve earlier time-to-market.

    2.	**Data scientists need human tools.** Today‘s tools are to
	compete rather than to collaborate. When multiple data scientists
	work on the same project, they are effectively competing to see
	who can build the better model. H1st breaks a large modeling
	problem into smaller, easier parts. This allows true collaboration
	and high productivity, in ways similar to well-established
	software engineering methodology.

    3.	**AI needs human trust.** AI models can't be deployed when
	they lack user trust. AI increasingly face regulatory challenges.
	H1st supports model description and explanation at multiple
	layers, enabling transparent and trustworthy AI.
