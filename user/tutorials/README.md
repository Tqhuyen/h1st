## Why is this directory needed?

### Top-Down, Outside-In Design

This directory is an inherent part of the framework.
API design from the client (user) perspective is done here.
All framework implementation should start _here_, whether by a framework product designer
or a framework implementor, but holding the perspective of the user of the frameworkâ€”not that of
its implementor.

In the limit, no framework implementation work should start without the client code design done here first.
